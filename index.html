	<h1>DIFFERENT NOTES AND WORK ABOUT POVERTY</h1>
	

	<p1>Poverty refers to the situation where different kinds of people from different areas lack enough basic needs one should have or even lack enough income to sustain their costs of living due to different factors.

Poverty can basically be caused by different factors like unemployment, war outbreaks, natural disasters that may destroy the population's properties, etc. And one of the solutions to poverty is that the government should encourage the youth to be creative and innovative in being more of job creators than being job seekers using the natural resources around the environment hence eradicating poverty.

Different organizations around the globe like UNHCR, IMF, ILO should at least provide different funds to the youth and especially the vulnerable people for them to get capital to create their own businesses hence reducing the rate of poverty. They should also provide support to different children, youth who lack enough scholastic materials to go to school for them to have a right to education since illiteracy is also among the causes of poverty in different societies around the globe.

Conclusively, poverty can be basically solved by we the youth because we have enough energy, and thoughts that are so resourceful so in that case, the youth should stand up and be more creative in creating our own businesses hence giving our fellows jobs and offering our countries more access to development like provision of taxes which are also used to perform different tasks like helping the vulnerable people, constructing different infrastructures and this becomes a cycle hence eradicating poverty.</p1>
